//              The parent process will ask user to enter a target string and replacement.
//              The child process(es) will do the replacement on the original article.

        learned multiple advantages and disadvantages of the Kindle devices and its system. 
        In the Individual Dimension's interview, the interviewee has been using multiple 
        generations of Kindle for over the past 7 years. Kindle is the main device that he 
        brings with him to work, school and even on vacations. He uses Kindle to read books 
        and sometimes to store his documents on the device. Throughout the interview, the 
        biggest selling point for Kindle that he mentioned is the convenience of it. 
        The device can last for weeks on a single charge. The reader can pick up where he or 
        she left off from the previous reading because the Kindle will always save the last 
        page of every book that you read. The device can hold almost all the reading materials 
        for the user. The interviewee said that because of convenience, he is more likely to 
        carry a Kindle with him all the time rather than a physical book. Imagine you are going 
        to bring a couple of books with you on vacation or a trip; travel with all these weights 
        isn't fun, which in turn, make you less likely to read. This example fits perfectly in 
        the student's textbook problem. Specifically, an average student in high school carries 
        several textbooks with them every week; typically, one textbook per class. Each textbook 
        normally weighs around 3 to 6 pounds. If a student is taking 5 to 6 classes in a semester, 
        that means 15 to 36 pounds of papers the student needs to carry to class every week. 
        Generally, a minor effect of carrying heavy backpacks is energy deprivation, which could 
        result in low performance in class and other activities. A more serious concern is chronic 
        back pain or other permanent damages done to the nerves in the neck and shoulders. 
        All the problems and concerns mentioned above can be solved by implementing Kindle in the 
        school system";
